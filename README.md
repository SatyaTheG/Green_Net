> [!NOTE]
> **Green Net is a website powered by Google's Gemini API that helps users find plants and trees that are easy and fast to grow in their location parameters and Air Quality Index.**
> 
## 🌳 How it Works

Users simply enter their location and the website will display curated recommendations of plants that are suitable for growing in that geographic area along with map visualization using layers. The plants show growth times so users know how long it will take to reach maturity. 

Each plant listing also includes link to guide with instructions on how to grow that species successfully. Users can share their recommendations to refer.
